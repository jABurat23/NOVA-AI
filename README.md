# 🚀 NOVA AI

NOVA AI is a full-stack intelligent assistant platform built with **React**, **Express**, and **Prisma**.  
It serves as a foundation for creating modern AI-driven applications — capable of processing commands, managing data, and interacting through a clean and responsive UI.

---

## 🧠 Overview

NOVA AI combines a **React-based frontend** and an **Express backend** connected through a **Prisma ORM**.  
The backend powers the AI logic, command handling, and API routes, while the frontend delivers an elegant and minimal interface for user interactions.

Key features:
- 🌐 Full-stack TypeScript/JavaScript architecture  
- ⚙️ Express API for AI command routing and modular extensions  
- 💾 Prisma-powered database with simple migrations and schema management  
- 🧩 Easily extensible structure for adding new AI capabilities  
- 🎨 Modern React UI with TailwindCSS  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Database:** Prisma ORM (with SQLite or PostgreSQL)  
**Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript (optional)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NOVA-AI.git
cd NOVA-AI
```
### 2. Install dependencies

Install backend and frontend dependencies separately:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
### 3. Configure your environment
```bash
Create a .env file in the backend directory and set your database URL:

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"  # for SQLite
# or
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/nova_ai"
```
### 4. Run Prisma migrations
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
### 5. Start the development servers
```bash
# Run backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run frontend
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once both servers are running:

 - Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

 - Backend API runs on http://localhost:5000

You can interact with NOVA AI via the frontend interface, or directly through the API endpoints to handle commands and manage AI modules.
```js
🧩 Example API Route
// Example: backend/routes/commands.js
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/execute", async (req, res) => {
  const { command } = req.body;
  // Handle AI command logic here
  res.json({ message: `Command "${command}" executed successfully.` });
});

export default router;
```

## 🪄 Development Notes

 - All AI command modules live inside /backend/routes/commands/
 - You can extend the database schema using Prisma models (/backend/prisma/schema.prisma)
 - Make sure to re-run migrations whenever schema changes are made
 - For production builds, configure your database in .env and run npm run build in both frontend and backend
